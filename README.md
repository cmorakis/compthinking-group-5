The final project is in the "Final" branch. It requires four files to run (FineDiningMain.py, ingredient.py, category.py, and recipes.csv). 

FineDiningMain.py needs to be run in order to use the complete program. The rest of the files are all used in the 'main' file. 

The purpose of the program is to print recipes for the user. The user has two options to do this. They can use: search by ingredient or search by category. Search by category will have the user pick a cateogry of food and select a recipe they want to see. Search by ingredient has the user input ingredients and gives recipes based on whether the recipe contians the user specified ingreidents.
